Repository for my up-coming/wip games

--Current Project:
Cat Face Clicker

Fun project I made while learning more about programming.
Click cat faces to earn points to purchase upgrades and boosts, pretty simple.

Instructions:
Download the setup file from here then it should open a prompt asking you where you want the game to be installed, choose the folder you'd like for the game to be installed in and then you'll be ready to play it when it's done. Installation should be short as the application is very small and in very early stages so far.

In case you dislike or don't want the game anymore it also adds an uninstallation app for your needs. ;(

Any feedback is appreciated <3
